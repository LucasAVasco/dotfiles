# Open the default file manager in a new window, even if it is a terminal-based file manager and the user opens it in a terminal emulator
#
# This is not a Linux standard functionality. I just use it in my scripts

# Dependencies:
# * bash
# * yazi
# * A script called `default_file_manager_synced` that opens the default file manager in the current terminal instance
