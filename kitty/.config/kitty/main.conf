# Main kitty configuration.
#
# This file will be included in the default kitty configuration file by the './setup.sh' script.
#
# Some automatically generated configurations are saved in the default 'kitty.conf' file (the theme, by example). To avoid including dynamic
# generated code in this repository, the default 'kitty.conf' file is not tracked by Git. Instead, the tracked configurations are placed in
# the current file, and the './setup.sh' script will include this configuration file in 'kitty.conf'. So the user can change themes and
# other configurations without adding the dynamic configurations to the repository
